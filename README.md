## üìñ About

With **[VideoSpeedup.com]** you easily change the playback speed of videos on Youtube, TikTok, Twitch,
Vimeo, Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ and many more video and streaming platforms.

You can use the predefined speed controls to watch videos faster (for example, at 3x speed) or slower.
You can also create custom speed controls to set any speed you want.

Additionally, you can control how the speed controls behave by tuning the available options.

## üìÉ Bookmarklet

VideoSpeedup works by providing easy to use bookmarklets ("speed controls") that work in all web browsers.
In this repository, you can find the [bookmarklet source code](src/lib/bookmarklet.js).
